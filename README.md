The life journey card game took inspiration from a Chinese real-life TV show “五十里桃花坞”.
Number of players: 2-5
Setup: 
* there are 18 varieties of life cards, each corresponding to a "good" element of life that people would love to have
* there are also 15 varieties of setback cards, each corresponding to bad things that can happen in life for 5 different stages

Rules:
* Players start by drawing 10 cards from a deck of 18 life cards (1 card for each variety)
* Players at each turn draw one setback card, and have the option to accept or reject it.
* If the player chooses to accept, then the setback card is added to their hand
* Otherwise, they have to play 2 life cards to cancel it out.
* The game can terminate any time, the main goal is to see what cards remain in everyone's hand since those reflect what they value most in life.

To run the program:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
